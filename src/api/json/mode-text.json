  "filter": "I created this filtering system in order to... OK, it was just fun. Not everything has be for some useful purpose, you know? Anyway, you can filter by the categories on the top row. The bottom row is all the options for that category, each with a thumbnail that probably came from that grouping. Clicking a thumbnail will show you all the artwork that, in my personal, arbitrary opinion, belongs to that option. The Browse by Album button on the left will let you see all of my albums.",
  "album": "This is my entire collection of artwork from the past 10 years or so, grouped by album. A lot of my older work doesn't have any other information, such as Year or Medium, so it can't be easily filtered. For the ones that can be filtered, there's a Filter button on the left."
