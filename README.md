# Can't Imagine Why
Art Website that allows display and filtering of pictures as well as purchase of original work and derived products.
Site design comes from a team of GA UXDI graduates. Implementation (so far) by just one graduate of GA SEI, who also happens to be the artist/client.

## Technology Stack

Front-end framework: ReactJS
Back-end API's: 
* Images: Cloudinary
* Products: Printful

## Requirements

The main requirement of this project is that it not cost me a dime. Since I don't expect to actually sell anything, the last thing I want is to be stuck paying operating costs just to keep my site running. Also, having a strict requirement like this makes development more fun.
