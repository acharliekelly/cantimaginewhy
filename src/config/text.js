  "plein-air-acrylic": `
  In the summer of 2019, I bought a portable easil that I could carry on my bike, along with my other
  art supplies, and started doing acrylic landscape paintings of local landmarks. By choosing scenes adjacent
  to public thoroughfares, I would get a pleasant stream of passers-by, complimenting my work.`,

  "scenery": `While I have a lot of pictures that could technically be classified as Scenery, these are 
  specifically the ones I did not create on site, but rather from a photograph. At least, in many cases, it was a 
  photo that I personally took, with the specific intention of painting it later.`,

  "portrait-new": `After a long break from portraiture, I decided to give it another try this winter (2019),
  once it got too cold for my Plein Air painting. The first group is a friend who photographs well.`,

  "logo": `Making logos is something I just do in my free time, whether or not a I need a logo for something.
  Mostly what I'm making is calligraphic monograms - artistic arrangements of initials. I've come up with a lot
  of them for the letters 'CIW', and also 'CK'.`,

  "sketch": `This was my first run at creating art on site, and requires a lot less packing than acrylic painting.
  I'm happy if I can make a landmark recognizable to someone who's seen it before.`,

  "nametag": `I've been involved in several different groups that use name tags. A lot of them use single-use 
  stickers (the ones that say "Hello My Name Is" at the top), and that's why I taught myself calligraphy (pays 
  off every time I go to a Meetup). But some groups use permanent name tags, and I always make a habit of making
  mine really, really nice. Which inevitably leads to other participants asking if I can make them one, too.
  Which of course I can, and do. The only contstraints are the size of the plastic name tag holders used by the
  specific group, and what information they require (eg just first name, or first, last, and preferred pronoun).
  I generally try to get their favorite color, too; just so the tag is more likely to go with their outfit.`,

  "illumination": `I started making Name Plates for people at work who had cubicles and therefore
  no placard on their office door. And then before I knew it, everybody wanted one. It's a person's name and
  whatever they're into - the place I worked when it started is a nonprofit for Aspergers, so a lot of people have
  REALLY strong interests. In this gallery, the interest is in the description field, under the name.`,

  "knotwork": `The first thing I ever wanted to be able to draw was Celtic knotwork. I made several attempts as a
  child, but without a specific design to copy, my patterns always ended up looking more like intestines. So, when I 
  took up drawing as an adult, learning to copy knotwork designs was my first goal. Eventually I started making up my
  own designs that did not immediately remind one of digestion.`,

  "holiday": `Sometimes I make holiday cards. The determining factor is whether or not I think of it at least a month
  before the holiday, giving me enough time to design, draw, scan, order, receive, and mail the cards. Normally, 
  I remember the day before the holiday, decide I'm definitely going to make something for the next holiday, and then
  don't. But these are some designs from the occasions when I did think of it in time.`,

  "aane": `For most of the past decade, I've been affiliated with/employed by an organization called AANE. (What that
  stands for changed over time, but at least one of the A's is usually Aspergers.) Anyway, at one time, their logo
  was stunningly dull: just block letters, arranged in a square. I suggested there might be more interesting ways
  of displaying four letters. And then I proceded to demonstrate.`,
